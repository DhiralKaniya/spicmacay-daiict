A disciple of the renowned Ustad Aashish Khan, he received the President’s Gold Medal Award in 2008 and was nominated for a Global Indian Music Award in 2012. He is a proponent of Indian classical techniques and wishes to share them, both to ensure their continuation and to breathe new life into them. To that end, he teaches music classes in his home and spreads his knowledge to a new generation of younger musicians, while also composing and arranging regional folk songs himself.</p>

                                <p>The Adalaj Stepwell is a popular tourist attraction of the city and is situated 18 kilometres (11 mi) away from Ghandhinagar. The well was built in 1499 A.D. by Queen Rudabai. The step well or Vav, as it is called in Gujarati, is intricately carved and is several stories deep. The carvings on its walls and pillars include leaves, flowers, birds, fish, geometrical patterns, and other breathtaking ornamental designs. In the past, these step wells were frequented by travellers and caravans as stopovers along trade routes.

                                This vav has five stories and three gates to enter it. On entering, one is greetet by one mandap with an eight-sided dome, which is now damaged. On both sides of steps are balconies with beautiful carvings. Rows of carved elephants mark some of the levels.</p>
